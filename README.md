# CS499_SecureNetNIDS

## Overview
SecureNet is a real-time Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that monitors and analyzes network traffic to detect suspicious activities or malicious attacks. It leverages machine learning to identify abnormal patterns and generates alerts for potential threats such as unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The system uses cybersecurity best practices, ensuring secure data transmission and a robust detection mechanism.
